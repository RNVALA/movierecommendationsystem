what is movie Recommendation System
Everyone loves movies irrespective of age, gender, race, color, or geographical location. We all in a way are connected to each other via this amazing medium. Yet what most interesting is the fact that how unique our choices and combinations are in terms of movie preferences. Some people like genre-specific movies be it a thriller, romance, or sci-fi, while others focus on lead actors and directors. When we take all that into account, itâ€™s astoundingly difficult to generalize a movie and say that everyone would like it. But with all that said, it is still seen that similar movies are liked by a specific part of the society.
so here i had done some Reserch and made a small project towards movie recommendation system, here i had take movie dataset from kaggle.
kaggle Dataset link is:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv
and i had also uploaded this movie recommendation system through Heroku
